# Internationalization (i18n)

We're using gettext for translations. All the actual translations are carried out via [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/).

Some commands wrap standard gettext tools. To run these commands you'll need to ensure you have done the following steps:

- Run `yarn` to install all the project dependencies.
- Install the [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) tools for your platform and make sure they're on your `$PATH` by checking the output of `which gettext`.

## Adding a new language/locale

The supported languages are defined in the configuration. See [`config/default.js`](https://bit.ly/1XScjwq) and look for the `langs` list.

Add the new language to the list and then run:

```
# create the locale for a newly added language.
NODE_PATH='./:./src' bin/create-locales
```

## Updating locales

Locales are updated automatically as a part of our CI. On every push to master `yarn extract-locales` is run which extracts locale strings from our codebase, merges any changes to the source language files and commits the changes.

You can run this command manually on your local environment any time to check the output strings.

Github actions internally prevent infinite loops by default.

## Setting up translations

To set up a component to be translated there are two pieces of code to know about.

### Jed

We use [Jed][jed] as the API for providing `gettext` functions inside React components. An initialized `Jed` instance has all the `gettext` related functionality exposed as methods. There is a fancy chained API but we've stuck to a more traditional approach.

Before we get into how to make use of these functions let's take a look at how the Jed instance is exposed to our components.

### The Translation Provider

The translation provider is used to pass down a Jed instance via context to components lower down in the component hierarchy. This part is already done for you in addons-frontend. So you should only need to worry about wrapping your components as detailed in the next section.

## The translate component wrapper.

The translate Higher Order Component is a helper that wraps any component and takes the Jed `i18n` instance from context and makes it available in the wrapped component's props.

Here's an example of a basic component setup for translation:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

import translate from 'core/i18n/translate';

export class MyTranslatedComponent extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    i18n: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  };

  render() {
    const { i18n } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{i18n.gettext('Something translated')}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default translate()(MyTranslatedComponent);
```

That's pretty much all there is to it.

## Using the Jed API

Once you have `i18n` available to your component you can then use any of the [Jed][jed] methods exposed on the `i18n` object.

```javascript
gettext = function ( key )
dgettext = function ( domain, key )
dcgettext = function ( domain, key, category )
ngettext = function ( singular_key, plural_key, value )
dngettext = function ( domain, singular_ley, plural_key, value )
dcngettext = function ( domain, singular_key, plural_key, value, category )
pgettext = function ( context, key )
dpgettext = function ( domain, context, key )
npgettext = function ( context, singular_key, plural_key, value )
dnpgettext = function ( domain, context, singular_key, plural_key, value )
dcnpgettext = function ( domain, context, singular_key, plural_key, value, category )
sprintf = function ( string, substitutions)
```

### Using `sprintf`

As you can see a sprintf function is also available. You can use this to provide substitutions in gettext wrapped strings.

There are two flavours to this, numbered placeholders or named ones.

Here's the numbered approach:

```javascript
i18n.sprintf(i18n.gettext('I like your %1$s %2$s.'), 'red', 'shirt'));
```

and here's the named arg approach:

```javascript
i18n.sprintf(i18n.gettext('I like your %(colour)s %(garment)s.'), { colour: 'red', garment: 'shirt' }));
```

Both of these approaches allow for translators to re-order the substitution vars.

### Guidance on HTML in translations

Generally we're looking to avoid having HTML in the middle of translation strings as much as possible.

If you need HTML it's better to use substitutions to add the HTML than leave HTML in the translation. Take the following string as an example:

```javascript
i18n.gettext('Take a look at the <a href="#">documentation</a>');
```

Using `sprintf` we can provide use start and end substitutions. This way there's no HTML in the extracted string.

```javascript
i18n.sprintf(
  i18n.gettext('Take a look at the %(start_link)sdocumentation%(end_link)s'),
  { start_link: '<a href="#">', end_link: '</a>' },
);
```

You can also use DOMPurify to sanitize strings that may contain HTML following substitutions so that anything not explicitly allowed is removed. DOMPurify will also help protect against malformed HTML in case opening and closing tag substitutions vars get swapped around inadvertently.
