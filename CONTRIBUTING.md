-   Please ask on the [dev-addons mailing list] before submitting pull-requests for new features or large changes that are not related to existing issues.
-   Please write tests for each patch to maintain test coverage.

Thank you for contributing!

## Note to staff

If you come across a potential `good first bug` for contributors, please tag it with `maybe good first bug`. The community team [triages] these every other week to ensure they have mentors assigned, onboarding information, and basic steps to get started. This gives new contributors a better experience when they pick a “good first bug” to work on.
