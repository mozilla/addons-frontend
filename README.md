# Addons-frontend ðŸ”¥

Front-end infrastructure and code to complement mozilla/addons-server

## Requirements

* Node 4.x LTS
* npm 3.x

The easiest way to manage multiple node versions in development is to use
nvm. See https://github.com/creationix/nvm for more info.

## Get started

* npm install
* npm run dev


## NPM scripts

### Running a production build of a specific app:

Running a specific prod build is as follows:

```
NODE_APP_INSTANCE=search NODE_ENV=production npm run build && npm run start
```

## Overview and rationale

This project will hold several distinct front-ends e.g:

* Editors search tool
* Discovery Pane
* and beyond...

We've made a conscious decision to avoid "premature modularization" and
keep this all in one repository. This will help us build out the necessary
tooling to support a universal front-end infrastructure without having to
worry about cutting packages and bumping versions the entire time.

At a later date if we need to move things out into their own project we
still can.

## Core technologies

* Based on Redux + React
* Code written in ES2015+
* Universal rendering via node
* Unit tests with high coverage (aiming for 100%)
