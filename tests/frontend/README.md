# Integration Tests for the [Mozilla Addons Website][amo].
## How to run the tests locally
### Clone the repository

If you have cloned this project already then you can skip this, otherwise you'll
need to clone this repo using Git. If you do not know how to clone a GitHub
repository, check out this [help page][git-clone] from GitHub.

Within this repo's clone, you will need to clone the [addons-server][addons-server] repo as well.

If you think you would like to contribute to the tests by writing or maintaining
them in the future, it would be a good idea to create a fork of this repository
first, and then clone that. GitHub also has great instructions for
[forking a repository][git-fork].

### Server Install

Follow the instructions found [here][addons-server-docs].

### Server setup for tests

The instructions to setup addons-server for selenium integration tests are found [here][addons-server-selenium-testing].

### Run the tests

The selenium tests can be run in a separate docker-compose file, specifically ``tests/frontend/docker-compose.selenium.yml``. This image contains Firefox Nightly. [tox][Tox]
is our test environment manager and [pytest][pytest] is the test runner.

To run the tests, execute the commands below in a python 3 virtual environment:
```sh
tests/frontend/-run-integration-test.sh
```

### Adding a test

The tests are written in Python using a POM, or Page Object Model. The plugin we use for this is called [pypom][pypom]. Please read the documentation there for good examples
on how to use the Page Object Model when writing tests.

The pytest plugin that we use for running tests has a number of advanced command
line options available too. The full documentation for the plugin can be found [here][pytest-selenium].

## Additional Information

The tests run against the newest version of the [AMO][amo] frontend using a docker image provided by [addons-frontend][addons-frontend]. You can view the frontend after the build has been completed at ```olympia.test``` which is the default these days. Make sure the hostname ```olympia``` is added to your hosts file.

### Watching a test run

The tests are run on a live version of Firefox, but they are run headless. To access the container where the tests are run to view them follow these steps. NOTE: You must have the appropriate containers set up. Please follow the instructions in the [docs][ReadTheDocs] first:

1. Make sure all of the containers are running:
```sh
docker-compose -f addons-server/docker-compose.yml -f tests/frontend/docker-compose.selenium.yml up -d
```

2. Create a Python 3 virtual env
3. Install the requirements: ```pip install --user --no-deps -r tests/frontend/requirements.txt```
4. Run the tests: ```python3 -m pytest tests/frontend --driver Firefox```

This will open a Firefox window with the tests running.

### Firefox setup

The preferences used to setup Firefox are here:
```sh
    firefox_options.set_preference(
        'extensions.install.requireBuiltInCerts', False)
    firefox_options.set_preference('xpinstall.signatures.required', False)
    firefox_options.set_preference('extensions.webapi.testing', True)
    firefox_options.set_preference('ui.popup.disable_autohide', True)
    firefox_options.add_argument('-foreground')
    firefox_options.log.level = 'trace'
```
These shouldn't need to be touched as they allow for unsigned addon installation as well as
disabling the autohide function and setting the Firefox browser to run headless.

If you do need to edit these settings, as mentioned above please visit the file ```conftest.py``` within this directory.

### Mobile and Desktop testing

If you would like to add or edit tests please consider that these are run on both a mobile resolution and a desktop resolution. The mobile resolution is ```738x414 (iPhone 7+)```, the desktop resolution is: ```1920x1080```. Your tests should be able to work on both.


### Debugging a failure

Whether a test passes or fails will result in a HTML report being created. This report will have detailed information of the test run and if a test does fail, it will provide geckodriver logs, terminal logs, as well as a screenshot of the browser when the test failed. We use a pytest plugin called [pytest-html][pytest-html] to create this report. The report can be found within the addons-server directory of the project and is named ```addons-server/ui-test.html```. It should be viewed within a browser.
